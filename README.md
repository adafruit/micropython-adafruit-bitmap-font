# DEPRECATED LIBRARY micropython-adafruit-bitmap-font

This library has been deprecated! We are leaving this up for historical and research purposes but archiving the repository.

We are now only supporting CircuitPython libraries.

This has been integrated into CircuitPython's framebuf library. Check it out if you're interested: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_framebuf
